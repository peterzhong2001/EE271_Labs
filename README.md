# EE271_Labs

This is a collection of the SystemVerilog labs that I have written for my EE 271 "Introduction to Digital Logic" class. I took this class at the University of Washington
during winter quarter 2021 with Prof. Scott Hauck. Lab 1-7 are relatively simpler projects, while lab 8 is a more comprehensive final project.
